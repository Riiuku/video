# video

### VIDEO-API
Simple api created in simplest stack (Spring boot + JPA) most hard part of it is WebSocket which should get and post byte array (NO BASE64)
### VIDEO-FRONTEND 
Written in React Why? Because I know Angular and now I want to learn React + Redux :)

### OTHER TODO :) Highly Kubernetes + Docker (Some nginx, ELK STACK?), Maybe other microservices (connection by rabbit or kafka) which will do something with BIG DATA but what? Idk for now
